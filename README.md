# Description

First attempt at creating a basic blockchain in Python.

Currently based off an IBM tutorial, with some tweaks and restructuring for
better use of Python Flask.

## Latest update

Completed up to step 7 (not inclusive). Need to test:
- create transactions
- mine using curl
- query blockchain

## Notes
- create methods=['POST'] routes for adding blocks to the blockchain
- include login and transaction views (via microblog flask tutorial)

## Future
- implement as a clearing house for bets made on Casino World
